    content: `It's not uncommon for a dog to be anxious and stressed during fireworks and other loud noises. Here are several ways you can help calm your dog to minimize the effects of these sounds.

6 Easy Ways to Calm an Anxious Dog
1. Turn on some calming music or white noise such as fans, air conditioners, or static. This will allow your dog to tune out some of the ambient noise around them, helping them relax more quickly without depending on outside stimuli such as food treats so much. (edited)

2. Create a "den" for your dog. A den is a safe space for them to retreat to so they can feel secure and safe to be away from all the noise outside. As part of the den, you will need several highly desirable food treats such as turkey hot dogs, chicken, cheese, etc. You will want about 12-15 goodies that are easily accessible at any given time during this training period. Put them in your pocket or close by. You may even want to put some treats on the other side of the room so that you need to move away from them before getting each one.
3. Turn off all lights or light up a dark room with only indirect lighting. This allows your dog's eyes to start to adjust, which can help calm their anxiety due to sensory overload.
4. Train! During fireworks, please take out your treats and start giving them out for any positive behavior such as: sitting, laying down, cuddling in a blanket, going into the den, etc. Start doing this well ahead of when the fireworks will go off, and continue until just after they have finished exploding to help your dog learn coping mechanisms to deal with the noise.

5. If your dog is not interested in treats during loud noises, enlist their help as part of a training game they like, such as fetch or tug of war which will make them want to play with you instead of run away from you. This may be more effective for some dogs than others, but it's worth trying.
6. Use calming treats with CBD.  Treats with CBD (cannabidiol) oil can help with the anxiety your dog is feeling. Some studies have shown that dogs receiving these treats respond better to treatment than those not receiving them, so it's worth trying.
